# Hello Github World ðŸ‘‹

My name is Dominik and I'm in the web industry since 2013, when I started my apprenticeship for media design.
Three years later after successfully graduating I moved to Berlin (Germany) to work as a webdesigner in a startup called **Websitebutler GmbH**, which later commercially released the tool **Sitejet** that had been used to create the websites all the years up to that point.

Early 2020 I decided to move on towards Frontend Engineering and was doing so in DÃ¼sseldorf (Germany) at **Compeon GmbH**, where I worked mostly remote from home.

From 2023 to late 2024 I was working on location at **Check24** in DÃ¼sseldorf, helping to create a new product in the frontend with Typescript, React, Nextjs and gRPC/protobuf.

From September 2024 I wanted to broaden my skill pallette and started working at **add2** in DÃ¼sseldorf, an agency for digital media of all kinds with plenty of internal tools to take care of. As Fullstack Engineer I'm responsible for maintaining, supervising and advancing our tech stack and customer projects, which gives me access to more frameworks and coding styles. Here I am working with typescript, AWS services, Vue3 and Nuxt and gained insights into Wordpress and Typo3. 

## My main focus is:
- Javascript/Typescript (React, Vue)

### Relevant skills from all work experiences and side projects include (in descending order of experience):
- CSS3
- HTML5
- Svelte
- Vue / Nuxt
- MongoDB
- nodejs and express
- Nextjs
- PHP / Wordpress
- Typo3
- Liquid (Shopify)

### Motivation
What I enjoy most is learning new things and applying the knowledge into apps, that work as they're supposed to do. 
And probably tinkering with details and cool stuff âœ¨ a bit too much. Aside of projects at work I also enjoy coding small games.
