### Hello Github World ðŸ‘‹

My name is Dominik and I've been in the web industry since 2013, when I started my apprenticeship for media design.
Three years later after successfully graduating I moved to Berlin (Germany) to work as a webdesigner in a startup called **Websitebutler GmbH**, which later commercially released the tool **Sitejet** that had been used to create the websites all the years up to that point.

Early 2020 I decided to move on towards Frontend Engineering and am doing so ever since in DÃ¼sseldorf (Germany) at **Compeon GmbH**, where I work mostly remote from home.

My main focus is:
- Javascript (React)

Relevant skills from all work experiences and side projects include:
- HTML5
- CSS3
- mongoDB
- Ruby on Rails

What I enjoy most is learning new things and applying the knowledge into apps, that work mostly as they're supposed to do. And probably tinkering with details and cool stuff âœ¨ a bit too much.
